# Alchemer Row and Columns
JavaScript code to enable Alchemer to total up the values of each row and column.

This was developed for non-coders to be able to copy and paste into the Alchemer (formerly SurveyGizmo) customization area in order to tally up the totals of each row and column with minimal adjustments.
Feel free to reach out with any questions or if you have improvements, but there didn't seem to be a solution out there yet and this works.
